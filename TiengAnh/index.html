        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Information Systems Ethics</h3>
        <p class="m-15">The term ethics is defined as “a set of moral principles” or “the principles of conduct
            governing an
            individual or a group.” Since the dawn of civilization, the study of ethics and their impact has fascinated
            mankind. But what do ethics have to do with information systems?

            The introduction of new technology can have a profound effect on human behavior. New technologies give us
            capabilities that we did not have before, which in turn create environments and situations that have not
            been specifically addressed in ethical terms. Those who master new technologies gain new power; those who
            cannot or do not master them may lose power. In 1913, Henry Ford implemented the first moving assembly line
            to create his Model T cars. While this was a great step forward technologically (and economically), the
            assembly line reduced the value of human beings in the production process. The development of the atomic
            bomb concentrated unimaginable power in the hands of one government, who then had to wrestle with the
            decision to use it. Today’s digital technologies have created new categories of ethical dilemmas.

            For example, the ability to anonymously make perfect copies of digital music has tempted many music fans to
            download copyrighted music for their own use without making payment to the music’s owner. Many of those who
            would never have walked into a music store and stolen a CD find themselves with dozens of illegally
            downloaded albums.

            Digital technologies have given us the ability to aggregate information from multiple sources to create
            profiles of people. What would have taken weeks of work in the past can now be done in seconds, allowing
            private organizations and governments to know more about individuals than at any time in history. This
            information has value, but also chips away at the privacy of consumers and citizens.</p>

        <p style="font-weight: bold;" class="m-15">Bài 2: Read the text and fill in the gaps in following sentences with
            NO MORE THAN THREE WORDS
        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Code of Ethics</h3>
        <p class="m-15">One method for navigating new ethical waters is a code of ethics. A code of ethics is a document
            that outlines a set of acceptable behaviors for a professional or social group; generally, it is agreed to
            by all members of the group. The document details different actions that are considered appropriate and
            inappropriate.

            One of the major advantages of creating a code of ethics is that it clarifies the acceptable standards of
            behavior for a professional group. The varied backgrounds and experiences of the members of a group lead to
            a variety of ideas regarding what is acceptable behavior. While to many the guidelines may seem obvious,
            having these items detailed provides clarity and consistency. Explicitly stating standards communicates the
            common guidelines to everyone in a clear manner.

            Having a code of ethics can also have some drawbacks. First of all, a code of ethics does not have legal
            authority; in other words, breaking a code of ethics is not a crime in itself. So what happens if someone
            violates one of the guidelines? Many codes of ethics include a section that describes how such situations
            will be handled. In many cases, repeated violations of the code result in expulsion from the group.

            In the case of ACM: “Adherence of professionals to a code of ethics is largely a voluntary matter. However,
            if a member does not follow this code by engaging in gross misconduct, membership in ACM may be terminated.”
            Expulsion from ACM may not have much of an impact on many individuals, since membership in ACM is usually
            not a requirement for employment. However, expulsion from other organizations, such as a state bar
            organization or medical board, could carry a huge impact.

            Another possible disadvantage of a code of ethics is that there is always a chance that important issues
            will arise that is not specifically addressed in the code. Technology is quickly changing, and a code of
            ethics might not be updated often enough to keep up with all of the changes. A good code of ethics, however,
            is written in a broad enough fashion that it can address the ethical issues of potential changes to
            technology while the organization behind the code makes revisions.

            Finally, a code of ethics could have also be a disadvantage in that it may not entirely reflect the ethics
            or morals of every member of the group. Organizations with a diverse membership may have internal conflicts
            as to what is acceptable behavior. For example, there may be a difference of opinion on the consumption of
            alcoholic beverages at company events. In such cases, the organization must make a choice about the
            importance of addressing a specific behavior in the code.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Intellectual Property</h3>
        <p class="m-15">One of the domains that has been deeply impacted by digital technologies is the domain of
            intellectual property. Digital technologies have driven a rise in new intellectual property claims and made
            it much more difficult to defend intellectual property.

            Intellectual property is defined as “property (as an idea, invention, or process) that derives from the work
            of the mind or intellect.” This could include creations such as song lyrics, a computer program, a new type
            of toaster, or even a sculpture.

            Practically speaking, it is very difficult to protect an idea. Instead, intellectual property laws are
            written to protect the tangible results of ideas. In other words, just coming up with a song in your head is
            not protected, but if you write it down it can be protected.

            Protection of intellectual property is important because it gives people an incentive to be creative.
            Innovators with great ideas will be more likely to pursue those ideas if they have a clear understanding of
            how they will benefit. In the US Constitution, Article 8, Section 8, the authors saw fit to recognize the
            importance of protecting creative works:

            Congress shall have the power to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited
            Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.

            An important point to note here is the “limited time” qualification. While protecting intellectual property
            is important because of the incentives it provides, it is also necessary to limit the amount of benefit that
            can be received and allow the results of ideas to become part of the public domain.

            Outside of the US, intellectual property protections vary. You can find out more about a specific country’s
            intellectual property law by visiting the World Intellectual Property Organization.</p>

        </p>
        <h3 style="text-align: center;">COPYRIGHT</h3>
        <p class="m-15">This is the law which is used to prevent others from unreasonable advantage of a person’s
            creative invention or work. Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 are three specified types of works which
            exists in the property right. To do work such as making a copy, broad casting or selling copies to the
            public, the owner is the only person who has exclusive right to act related to the work.

            The qualification requirements are original literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works; sound recordings,
            films or broadcasts; and the typographical arrangements of published editions.

            In general, copyright is the thing which is given to the owner of the original work or an inventor. The
            works available on the internet environment are also protected by copyright. This copyright law provides a
            maintaining balance of rights between the inventors that means the original copyright owners for enough
            payment for the use of their works, and rights to access the ideas and information by the society. We can
            conclude the meaning of copyright in simple way that copyright does not protect ideas, but only the
            expression or product of ideas.

            The copyright law not only protects the work but also it should not give any rise to monopolies and it is
            permissible to any person to submit the work which is similar to the work available before, that is pre-
            existing work as long as the later work is not taken from the first. Patents Act 1988, Copyright and Designs
            were passed, this is considered as the major advancement is technology. Due to the account of moral rights
            and inalienable rights this Act has due which belongs to the author irrespective of the ownership of
            copyright.

            Copyright is totally different by other laws provided by intellectual property rights. It gives perfect
            right to the authorities that means the owners and does not give rise to monopolies. It is an act giving
            rise to infringement of copyright may be associated with or accompany a breach of confidence.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">IDENTIFICATION OF PROBLEM AREA COMPUTER SOFTWARE</h3>
        <p class="m-15">A range of intellectual property laws are associated in the protection of computer software.
            These laws which are created generally confine the use of software, both domestically and internationally.
            The various problems addressed here are which software can be patented. Software is written with the help of
            software. There are miles of similar code in programs that perform similar functions. Not so in novels,
            musical compositions, and other fine art. Another problem is the software piracy. Software has some problems
            and the manufacture always releases upgrades and this is significantly costlier than the previous one. So
            these kinds of things generally lead to piracy of the software. Though computer software is normally not
            considered as patentable, today fundamentally any procedure or method that can be implemented in a computer
            software or program that manufactures a valuable result is patentable if properly described thoroughly and
            claimed completely. Another issue which imposes intellectual property is the software piracy. It is
            generally unauthorized duplication and illegal sharing of software and also distribution of it either for
            personal use or for business. Pirated software offends everyone right from the developer who created the
            software, the store owners and mainly to all the users of the software. Additionally, the economic is badly
            affected by the duplication of software as well as distribution of software.

            In terms of protecting the computer software legally, there are three important points for the copyright
            owners need to be considered. The first one is copying the software by out and out piracy. This is mainly
            done for the Operating systems software like Windows, software related to games and famous software
            application like software used for word processing. Specially written software particularly comes under
            second and third concerns. Usually these software are written for business or companies in order to perform
            its operations or functions.

            The advancement in latest technology extends the law which makes it to react slowly sometimes and one crisis
            has been the method in which it has been challenged to adjust the present legal concepts to pact with the
            difficulty caused by the technological advancements.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Computer Crime</h3>
        <p class="m-15">Computer Crime is intellectual, white-collar crime. Those that commit such crimes must be
            intelligent enough to manipulate a computer system and in such a position to access it in the first place.
            One example of computer crime is stealing funds via computer. Often the worst that can happen to such a
            thief is that he/she is merely required to return the stolen money. Many times that person will be fired,
            assuming he/she is an employee, but may be quickly hired by a competitor because of his/her skill. This
            creates practically no deterrent to committing computer theft because legal action is not often taken
            against the perpetrator. Another example is unauthorized computer entry. In entering a computer
            unauthorized, the perpetrator can steal a company's trade secrets and data. Such a crime could be committed
            by an employee aiming to sell such secrets to a competitor or by an outside source wanting to steal such
            secrets to promote his/her own well-being. This crime involves both an invasion of property and privacy and
            also compromises the computer system itself. This crime goes along with the idea of hacking. Hacking is
            defined as "any computer-related activity which is not sanctioned or approved of by an employer or owner of
            a system or network” (Forester 44). Such an activity deals with the ethical dilemma of who actually owns
            information and who should have access to that information. At many universities, Computer Science
            professors have their students hack into the university's system to prove their skill and knowledge of
            computer systems. This poses a serious ethical dilemma. Since the students are not causing any harm to the
            system, is such an action morally reprehensible or acceptable? Many computer professionals feel that this
            act is not ethically sanctioned and the Computer Science professors must address the issue of computer
            ethics more fervently in their classes.</p>

        <p class="m-15">Debugging is basically making sure that a program does not have any errors so that it can run
            properly without any problems. Debugging is a large part of what a programmer does. The first step to
            debugging is done before you can actually debug the program; the program needs to be changed into machine
            language so that the computer can read it. It is converted using a language translator. The first goal of
            debugging is to get rid of syntax errors and any errors that prevent the program from running. Errors that
            prevent the program from running are compiler errors. These need to be removed right away because otherwise
            you cannot test any of the other parts of the program.Syntax errors occur when the programmer has not
            followed the correct rules of the programming language. Another kind of error is a runtime error, which
            occurs while the program is running and it is not noticed until after all syntax errors are corrected. Many
            runtime errors are because of logic errors, which are errors in the logic of the program. It could occur
            when a formula is written incorrectly or when a wrong variable name is used.

            There are different types of debugging techniques that can be used. One technique called print debugging, or
            also known as the print method, finds errors by watching the print (or trace) statement live or recorded to
            see the execution flow of the process. This method originated in the early versions of the BASIC programming
            language. Remote debugging is the method of finding errors using a remote system to run the program and
            collect information to find the error in the code. If the program has already crashed, then post-mortem
            debugging can be used through various tracing techniques and by analyzing the memory dump of the program.
            Another technique is one created by Edward Gauss called wolf-fence debugging. Basically, this method find
            the error by zeroing in on the problem by continuous divisions or sectioning until the bug is found. Similar
            to this is the saff squeeze technique which uses progressive inlining of a failure test to isolate the
            problem.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">TEST, IMPLEMENTATION, MAINTENANCE</h3>
        <p class="m-15">Relating to getting a program up and running, many things need to happen before it can be used.
            One step is to test the program. After the debugging process occurs, another programmer needs to test the
            program for any additional errors that could be involved in the background of the program. This person needs
            to perform all of the tasks that an actual user of the program would use and follow. To ensure privacy
            rights, test data is used in the testing process. However, this still has the same structure and feel to the
            actual data. The tester needs to check for possible input errors as well, as this would create many problems
            and issues in the future had it not been checked. Companies usually implement different types of tests. An
            Alpha test is first conducted, which is on-site at the company, and Beta tests are sent out to different
            states or countries to ensure the program is 100% ready for use. The Alpha test occurs before the Beta test.
            Once the debugging and testing are finished, the program is now in the system and the program implementation
            and maintenance phase are completed. Program maintenance still needs to be kept up, in case of future
            errors. This is the most costly to organizations because the programmers need to keep improving and fixing
            issues within the program.

            As stated earlier, a program goes through extensive testing before it is released to the public for use. The
            two types of testing are called Alpha and Beta testing. Alpha testing is done “in house” so to speak. It is
            done within a company prior to sending it to Beta testing and its intention in this early stage is to
            improve the product as much as possible to get it Beta ready. Beta testing is done “out of house” and gives
            real customers a chance to try the program with the set intention of catching any bugs or errors prior to it
            being fully released. Alpha testing is the phase that takes the longest and can sometimes last three to five
            times longer than Beta. However, Beta testing can be completed in just a few weeks, assuming no major bugs
            are detected. Alpha testing is typically performed by engineers or other employees of the company while Beta
            testing occurs in the “real world”, temporarily being released to the public to get the widest range of
            feedback possible. If all goes well in both phases, the product is ready to be released and enjoyed by the
            public.

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">DESKTOP PUBLISHING PROCESS OVERVIEW</h3>
        <p class="m-15">MAKE A SKETCH <br>

            Before even opening the software it is wise to have an idea where you are going with your design. What do
            you want to create? You could skip this step but it is recommended to try to do a few thumbnail sketches
            first.

            <br> CHOOSE A TEMPLATE <br>

            If your chosen software has templates for the type of project you plan to do, take a look at those templates
            to see if they will work properly with a little tweaking for your project. Using a template can be faster
            than starting from scratch and a great way for those new to desktop publishing to get started. Or, as an
            alternative, find a tutorial for your software that takes you through the steps of learning the software
            while doing a specific project such as a greeting card, business card, or brochure.

            <br> SET UP YOUR DOCUMENT <br>

            If using a template, you may need to tweak some of the template settings. If starting from scratch, set the
            size and orientation of your document, set the margins. If you'll be doing text in columns, set up text
            columns. The specific steps you take in the document setup will vary from one type of project to the next.​

            <br> PLACE TEXT IN YOUR DOCUMENT <br>

            If your document is mostly text, place it in your layout by importing it from a file, copying it from
            another program, or typing it directly in your program.

            <br> FORMAT YOUR TEXT <br>

            Align your text. Apply the desired typeface, style, size, and spacing to your text. You may end up making
            some changes later, but go ahead and select the fonts you believe you want to use. Apply embellishments such
            as plain or fancy drop caps. The specific steps of coposing the text that you choose will depend on the
            amount of text and the type of document you are preparing.

            <br> PLACE GRAPHICS IN YOUR DOCUMENT <br>

            If your document is mostly graphics-based, you may want to place the images before adding bits of text.
            Import your graphics from a file, copy them from another program, or create them directly in your page
            layout software (simple boxes, rules, etc.). You can even do some drawing and graphics creation right in
            your page layout program.

            <br> TWEAK YOUR GRAPHICS PLACEMENT <br>

            Move your graphics around so that they line up the way you want them. Set up your graphics so that text
            wraps around them. Crop or resize graphics if necessary .

            <br> APPLY THE RULES OF DESKTOP PUBLISHING <br>

            Once you have your initial layout, improve and fine-tune. Simply applying these tried and true methods of
            arranging a page and doing desktop publishing will result in more attractive pages even without formal
            graphic design training. In brief: drop typewritten conventions such as two spaces after periods and double
            hard returns between paragraphs; use fewer fonts, less clip art; leave white space in the layout; avoid most
            centered and justified text.

            <br> PRINT A DRAFT AND PROOFREAD IT <br>

            You can proofread on-screen but it's always a good idea to print out your project. Proof your printout not
            only for colors (colors on screen don't always print as expected), typographical errors, and placement of
            elements. If it is to be folded or trimmed, make sure it folds properly and that trim marks print correctly.
            Think you've caught all the errors? Proofread it again.

            <br> PRINT YOUR PROJECT <br>

            Once you're happy with your layout and your proofs are printing properly, print your creation on your
            desktop printer. Ideally, even before you finalize your design you've gone through all the preparatory steps
            for desktop printing including calibration, print options, previews, and troubleshooting.

        <p class="m-15">1. Make sure that the computer is set to boot first from the CD/DVD drive. To do this, enter the
            BIOS Setup program when starting up the computer. This will require pressing a key during startup. The key
            (often one of the function keys or the delete key) is specified at the bottom of the first screen during
            boot up. When the BIOS Setup program opens, scroll down (using the down arrow) to the “First Boot Device”
            line, and then use the onscreen instructions to select CDROM and save the change.

            2. Shut down the computer, put the operating system CD or DVD into the drive, and then start the computer
            again.

            3. The installation will automatically start, and you will be guided through the process by on screen tips
            and questions. Make sure you read each screen!

            4. You will be asked for your preferences in regards to installation language, time and currency formats and
            keyboard layouts. Please note that the more common keyboard layout in your country might be United States
            English, even for those using the British English language.

            5. When prompted, enter the product key (for Microsoft Windows operating systems). This is an important step
            for affirming the legality of your copy, and will allow your computer full access to online updates. Make
            sure, however, that you know how many computers your product license is good for, and then do not load the
            operating system onto too many computers.

            6. When prompted, choose the location (which partition) for installing the operating system. You may also be
            given the option of creating new partitions at this step. If so, the partition created for the operating
            system should be at least 20GB, preferably 30GB. Make sure that you format the partition using the NTFS file
            system.

            7. Follow any more on screen prompts and then wait patiently for the installation to finish.

            8. Don’t forget to change your boot order back to the original setting!

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">HOW TO INSTALL THE LATEST DRIVER FOR YOUR PRINTER</h3>
        <p class="m-15">Most printers require that you install the latest printer driver so that the printer will work
            well. If you recently upgraded from an earlier version of Windows, your printer driver might work with the
            previous version but might not work well or at all with Windows 10. Also, if you've experienced power
            outages, computer viruses, or other problems, your printer driver might be damaged. Downloading and
            installing the latest printer driver can often resolve these problems. Here are several ways to do this.

            Use Windows Update

            Windows Update might find an updated version of your printer driver. To use it: Select the Start button,
            then select Settings > Update & Security , and select Check for updates. If Windows Update finds an updated
            driver, it will download and install it, and your printer will automatically use it.

            Install software that came with your printer

            If your printer came with a disc, it might contain software that can help you install drivers for your
            printer or check for driver updates.

            Download and install the driver from the printer manufacturer’s website

            Check your printer manufacturer’s support site. To find that, search the internet for the name of your
            printer manufacturer plus the word “support,” such as “HP support.” Driver updates are often available in
            the “Drivers” section of a printer manufacturer’s website. Some support sites let you search for your
            printer model number directly. Locate and download the latest driver for your printer model, then follow the
            installation instructions on the manufacturer’s website. Most drivers are self-installing. After you
            download them, double-click (or double-tap) the file to begin installing it. Then follow these steps to
            remove and reinstall the printer.

            1. Select the Start button, then select Settings> Devices > Printers & scanners.

            2. Under Printers & scanners, find the printer, select it, and then select Remove device.

            3. After removing your printer, add it back by selecting Add a printer or scanner. Wait for your device to
            find nearby printers, choose the one you want, and then select Add device.

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">COMPUTER MAINTENANCE</h3>
        <p class="m-15">Computer maintenance keeps your computer working in good shape and contributes to keeping
            computer troubles at bay. Typical computer maintenance tasks include:

            Back Up Your Files

            One of the most stressful experiences for a computer user is data loss, which means that parts of a database
            can no longer be retrieved. Your best insurance policy is to create a backup of your files. You can burn a
            CD or DVD with your most critical files, copy your files to an external hard disk drive or use an online
            backup service. Whatever strategy you use, just make sure to create a backup copy of your files on a regular
            basis.

            Use Antivirus Software

            Antivirus software helps to protect a computer system from viruses and other harmful programs. As the first
            line of defense, antivirus software prevents viruses from getting into your computer system. Antivirus
            software scans your online activity to make sure you are not downloading infected files. Antivirus software
            also helps to detect and remove viruses from your computer system if you get infected. Running antivirus
            software and keeping it up to date is one of the most important things you can do as part of computer
            maintenance.

            Install Software Updates

            A software update provides minor software enhancements. This typically means that you have to download a
            file that installs these updates. Most updates are related to security issues and bug fixes. The effects of
            an update may not be immediately visible to you, but behind the scenes, the updates make your software run
            smoother. A software update is also called a patch because it's 'patching' the software. Updates apply to
            both operating systems and application software. Most software applications have built-in settings that
            check for the availability of updates. This is why you may get regular notices on your computer asking if
            you want to install updates.

            Use Disk Tools

            Disk tools include a range of different tools to manage hard disk drives and other storage devices. These
            are important because a hard disk drive failure can have disastrous consequences, including losing all your
            data. In addition, the speed at which data is transferred to and from a hard disk drive is often a limiting
            factor in the overall speed of a computer system. Keeping disks running securely and efficiently is an
            important part of overall computer maintenance. Some of the recommended disk tools you should use on a
            regular basis are disk cleaning and disk defragmentation. A disk cleaner removes any unnecessary files from
            your hard disk drive. Running a disk cleanup utility identifies the files you may no longer need and allows
            you to select the types of files you no longer want to keep. This will free up hard disk space. A disk
            defragmenter re-organizes file fragments on a hard disk drive to increase performance. Defragmentation
            should be done regularly as part of regular computer maintenance.

            Physical Cleaning

            After a certain amount of use, computers will need some cleaning, like any other piece of equipment. The
            keyboard, in particular, can collect dust, liquid, food and other particles. This may cause the keyboard to
            not work properly. Other elements of your computer system may also need cleaning once in a while, such as
            the mouse and the monitor.

        <p class="m-15">Apple Watch is the world’s best-selling watch, and Apple Watch Series 3 apparently does
            something many have wanted from the start - it can potentially replace your phone.

            Screen

            The OLED screen is the same as before. It’s beautifully bright and colorful. All interactions with the watch
            are carried out using the responsive touchscreen, which is a joy to use.

            No Phone Needed

            If you choose Apple Watch Series 3, you’ll get a watch witha built-in eSIM, ready to connect to a cellular
            network and enable operation without your phone. It’s a virtual one that uses the same number as your phone,
            so all the usual phone-based activities are replicated on your wrist.

            Making a phone call is straightforward enough, but hearing the caller when outside is a challenge as the
            speaker isn’t very loud. Apple’s iMessages can be sent and replied to, using the scribble system, or simply
            using your voice.

            However, use apps outside Apple’s ecosystem and problems start to emerge. Even apps with Apple Watch
            versions, like Twitter, Line, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger, require the phone to be connected to the
            watch to operate.

            Performance

            Apple Watch Series 3 has a new dual-core processor and the new model is undeniably faster than ever. If
            you’re used to the Apple Watch Series 1, it’ll be a revelation. It’s smoother and faster to respond, and it
            zips through multiple apps.

            Fitness

            Apple Watch is a superb fitness, health, and lifestyle tracker. It’s clear, precise, and informative, with
            many different modes to suit the majority of people. If you just want to know steps and calories burned, the
            three-ring system works brilliantly. Adding heart rate monitoring is easy, and there are varied tracking
            options for walking, running, cycling, and swimming. Everything gets collated in the Activity app on your
            phone, where it’s laid out in an easy-to-understand way.

            Verdict

            The one major new feature of Apple Watch Series 3 - cellular connectivity - isn’t a reason to buy it. But
            Apple’s Watch was already the best smartwatch you could buy, and the powerful processor, smooth performance
            and sensible software enhancements have ensured it easily retains that title for the near future.

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Best Big Screen: iPhone 11 Pro Max</h3>
        <p class="m-15">Apple returns to normal numbers with the 2019 iPhone lineup, ousting the prior iPhone XS Max for
            the new iPhone 11 Pro Max. While the name is a bit of a mouthful, both the "Pro" and "Max" monikers are
            well-deserved, with performance that runs circles around most other smartphones and an impressive 6.5-inch
            OLED display that provides rich color and obsidian-deep blacks.

            With the new triple-lens system, Apple has added a 13mm ultra-wide-angle shooter to the previous combo of
            standard wide-angle and telephoto lenses, meaning you can now capture stunning nature vistas without
            worrying about backing off the edge of a cliff to fit everything in. The A13 Bionic CPU is the fastest chip
            ever put into a mobile phone, and while it’s more than you’ll need simply for playing games, the real
            benefit is the advanced photography. Night Mode lets you take visible and highly detailed photos in
            near-darkness while "Deep Fusion" introduces pixel-level photo blending.

            The "Super Retina XDR" OLED display shows off your photos, videos, and movies with incredible color
            accuracy, thanks to a 2,000,000:1 contrast ratio, 458 PPI pixel density, and True Tone ambient light
            matching. Dolby Vision and HDR10 mean even feature films look great on the expansive 6.5-inch screen. And
            with five hours more battery life than the prior "Max" model, you can also keep the movies playing for up to
            17 hours on a single charge.

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">LG C7 Series (OLED55C7P) Review</h3>
        <p class="m-15">In this review, we’ll explain why the C7 earns our affection over other competitive models.
            We’ve also got some illuminating comments on what LG did to make its 2017 OLED TVs significantly better than
            its 2016 models.

            Picture Performance

            The LG C7 OLED TV produces the best picture quality we’ve ever seen in a consumer-grade display. It offers
            perfect black levels, outstanding contrast, excellent color, and incredible depth and texture. The LG C7
            screen is gorgeous and when you see it, it will ruin you for any other TV.

            For 2017, LG improved peak brightness by 20%, improved the lowest part of the black range, adding more
            subtle gradients for better shadow detail, changed the anti-reflective screen coating so that the display
            looks deep black when turned off. Together, they make a significant difference.

            Audio Performance

            The LG C7 OLED TV doesn’t sound half bad! If that doesn’t sound like a ringing endorsement, consider that
            most ultra-thin TVs sound quite deplorable. The C7 has enough oomph to stand on its own, and it deservesat
            least good soundbar, or better yet, a full-on home theater surround sound system.

            Ease of Use

            With the exception of Samsung TVs armed with Tizen OS, you will not find an easier to use TV than those
            featuring LG’s Web OS. What puts LG slightly ahead of its competitors is the inclusion of the Magic Motion
            remote, which gives users the option of pointing and clicking their way through menus like they might with a
            Nintendo Wii controller. We think the Magic Motion remote is the best solution to lengthy and time-consuming
            username, password, and other types of text entry.

            Web OS is so simple, and it has a very solid voice search feature, making content you want to watch easy to
            find. Moreover, Web OS is well optimized to stream HDR content from apps like Netflix and Amazon Video, and
            it proudly presents corresponding graphics any time HDR content is detected.

            Verdict

            Subtle improvements LG made to its OLED line for 2017 were significant enough to get us just that much more
            excited for OLED TVs, and the LG C7 OLED is the best choice of the crop. Simply put, you can’t buy a better
            TV in 2017.

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">How IT Support Can Help Your Business</h3>
        <p class="m-15">With more businesses deploying different types of technology to increase productivity, it can
            become a monumental challenge to stay current with every new IT process that requires support. If you are
            struggling to keep up with the next generation IT services, the good news is that there are professional IT
            support services available that can help you relieve the burden of trying to stay on top of every aspect of
            your IT infrastructure.

            To choose the approach that is best for your business it helps to know what options are available to you
            when it comes to outsourcing IT support. Many quality IT support services will work with you to plan the
            best approach however, here is an overview of the different types of IT support services to help you get
            started.

            IT Support: While some companies prefer to employ an in-house IT team others find it more cost effective to
            outsource IT support. This leaves more time for new IT initiatives which support company growth and revenue.
            Here are some of the ways that you can outsource IT support to a qualified IT support provider:

            Network Security: Network security can be a significant challenge for any businesses and at the same time it
            is a necessity in today’s business environment. By outsourcing network security tasks to a quality IT
            provider, you can rest a little easier knowing your network is safe from the latest threats and your network
            is continually monitored for vulnerabilities. Outsourced IT support for network security also means that
            your network stays updated with the latest security patches, firewalls, and intrusion detection systems
            which ensure critical data stays secure.

            Data Backup and Recovery: Data backup and recovery can be a costly venture. By using an IT support provider
            which offers data backup and recovery you can securely backup critical data and obtain access to it in the
            event disaster strikes. Also, when you use a cloud solution, it is much more cost-effective than deploying
            other offsite methods for protecting data.

            Email Services: Most businesses rely heavily on email for daily communications and quality customer service.
            Around the clock email productivity and protection is a must but the costs of monitoring the architecture
            can take a big bite out of small business profits. IT support providers which provide email services can
            help you to manage, monitor, and protect your email systems at a much lower cost than if you deployed the
            necessary infrastructure in-house.

            As a final note, you should always take the time to do your research to ensure you are working with a
            reliable and experienced IT provider to avoid any additional costs associated with a poorly managed service.

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">What does Technical Support (Tech Support) mean?</h3>
        <p class="m-15">Technical support (tech support) refers to a range services companies provide to their
            customers for products such as software, mobile phones, printers, and other electronic, mechanical
            or electromechanical products. Technical support services usually focus on solving common problems
            rather than providing training on how to use the product.

            Technical support is usually delivered over telephone, via email, over chat (IM) or using special
            software or software extensions that the user can employ to directly contact tech support. Technical
            support representatives are very familiar with the ins and outs of the products for which they
            provide support. If there is a problem that cannot be solved by the tech support, it is escalated to
            the development team and logged as a bug that should be fixed by a future product update or the next
            product iteration.

            There are a few key types of technical support:

            Time and Material: This type of support is common in the tech industry. Also known as "break-fix" IT
            support, the payment of the materials and technician service charge falls upon the customer for a
            pre-negotiated rate.

            Managed Services: This is usually given to large-scale customers rather than individual consumers. A
            list of well-defined services and performance indicators are provided to the customer on an ongoing
            basis for a fixed rate, which is agreed upon on contract. Services provided could be 24/7 monitoring
            of servers, 24/7 help desk and the like. This may include on-site visits when problems cannot be
            solved remotely.

            Block Hours: This is a prepaid support system where the customer pays for a certain amount of time,
            which can be used per month or per year. This allows customers to use the hours flexibly without the
            hassle of paper work or multiple bills.

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">Four ways to find your dream job</h3>
        <p class="m-15">The first and most important aspect to getting anything you want is knowing what you want. If
            you don’t really know what your dream job is, you will never find it.

            Finding your dream job by focusing

            The idea here is taking your love of something (for example, communication) and focusing it on a specific
            career path (for example, reporting the T.V. news). That focus will help you get your dream job because you
            will be in a better position to pursue your dream.

            Earn your dream job because you can do it

            By today’s standards, a degree doesn’t necessarily qualify you to do anything! You shouldn’t wait until you
            finish school to start doing what you love. Want that dream job of being a news reporter? Join CNN iReport
            or start your own blog where you report local news.

            Gain experience through your school

            You can pursue your dream job even through the college or university where you are obtaining your education.
            Everything from student teaching to volunteering in the library can help you gain experience while you study
            the academics of your major.

            Find the job you want through confidence

            When you learn how to do something and then you practice, you build confidence, and that will help you get
            the job you want. Your dream job is likely to be in a competitive field. Having the confidence to stand
            behind your qualifications will help you get your foot in the door.
        </p>
        <span>1. If you take your love of something and concentrate it on a
            <span style="color: red;"> specific career path </span>, you will be in better position to follow your
            dream.<br>
            2.According to today's standards, a
            <span style="color: red;"> degree
            </span> may not give you the skills and knowledge that you need to do anything.<br>

        <p class="m-15">No single job suits all of us, but many of the best ones have a few attributes in common: They
            pay well, challenge us year after year, match our talents and skills, aren't too stressful, offer room to
            advance throughout our careers and provide a satisfying work-life balance. Whether the position is in demand
            is also a consideration, especially among job seekers. U.S. News uses these qualities to rank the one
            hundred best Jobs of 2019. Software developer, statistician, physician assistant, dentist and orthodontist
            are among the top-ranked careers on the list. And here is some information about information security
            analysts .Information security analysts are the gatekeepers or security guards of information systems. To
            explain it another way: These professionals plan and execute security measures to shield an organization's
            computer systems and networks from infiltration and cyber attacks.

            They prevent, monitor and respond to data breaches and cyber attacks, which are becoming more common. The
            Ashley Madison website was hacked in 2015, while Sony experienced a major attack in 2014, as did JPMorgan
            Chase & Co. And no one can forget all the shoppers compromised in Target's major data breach in 2013.

            Andrea Hoy, president of the Information Systems Security Association's international board of directors,
            was always interested in how things worked. As a child, she would take apart malfunctioning toys and piece
            them back together, sometimes successfully and sometimes unsuccessfully. "I may have hid the leftover parts
            in my closet," she says, jokingly. Later, this interest turned to computers, where she enjoyed the challenge
            of capturing viruses and dissecting malware.
            The U.S. government, health care organizations, financial systems and other companies are growing more
            reliant on information security analysts to protect their information systems against hackers and cyber
            attacks. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects 28.5 percent employment growth for information security
            analysts between 2016 and 2026. In that period, an estimated 28,500 jobs should open up.

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">TIPS FOR JOB SEEKERS</h3>

        <p class="m-15">Once you have an idea of the type of job you want in tourism, and once you have completed any
            required training, it’s time to land that coveted job. This requires a methodical plan: write a résumé that
            highlights your key skills, prepare for difficult interview questions, target companies you're going to
            contact directly, and prepare with the latest techniques for marketing yourself and networking effectively.

            Preparing your résumé and cover letter

            One of your first steps should be to prepare an up-to-date résumé that highlights your training, work
            experience, additional language skills and volunteer activities. Attention to detail is important to all
            employers, so ensure that your cover letter and résumé are free of spelling and grammatical errors.A cover
            letter should be no more than one page – preferably bullet points or short paragraphs. You should customize
            it for each job application.

            Learn about your potential employers

            Are there people in your community or circle of acquaintances who are doing the type of work that interests
            you? Contact them to find out what skills and experience they think you'll need. Read through job
            descriptions on job-search websites. From your research, develop a list of companies you want to work for,
            then contact the companies directly regarding current or future job opportunities.

            Use your network

            Not all jobs are advertised. Many positions are filled by people who have been recommended by someone they
            know. Be sure to tell friends, relatives and neighbors that you are looking for a tourism job; they may know
            somebody who is hiring or who can help get you started.

            Become a volunteer

            Volunteering helps you meet people in the tourism industry and build experience, which is especially
            important for job seekers who are just starting out in the workforce. Some employers hire volunteers to help
            during the busy season, and many event organizers offer volunteer opportunities.

            Be flexible

            Generally, tourism is an industry that operates around the clock and experiences high and low seasons. Be
            flexible and expect to work shifts outside of a typical work week. Plan to be available on evenings and
            weekends, especially when you are starting out.
        </p>
        <span>1. In order to get the desired position, job seekers need to follow a
            <span style="color: red;"> methodical plan </span> <br>
            2.There are

            Gertrude P. Webb

            Human Resources Manager

            Cellubop Gershwin Enterprises

            2355 Noble Barnes Avenue

            Cincinnati, OH 45236

            Dear Gertrude,

            At present, I’m an IT technician assistant for a warehouse of about 300 factory workers, and I manage all
            levels of hardware, software, and network issues. Yesterday, I stumbled upon your call for a new IT
            technician at Cellubop Gershwin, and I immediately pictured myself there.

            My over three years of experience focused mostly on issues with instruments on the factory floor (e.g.,
            handheld computers, receiving tablets). However, I also ensured the managers and executives in the office
            maintained hardware performance and network connectivity. I’m privileged to have accomplished some high
            achievements, including:

            - Acquired ownership of onboarding classes for computer hardware and operation for all new recruits and I’ve
            held 20 such group classes since.

            - Pushed for and spearheaded a factory-wide upgrade of operating systems, from OS 3.5 to OS 4.1, which
            increased performance by 5%.

            - Appropriated task of replacing handheld computers for the receiving team, keeping total purchases $5,000
            under budget while upgrading to gadgets which will last 5+ years.

            - Assist personnel with installation, configuration and ongoing usability of system hardware and software

            - Offer daily operations and systems support to personnel

            - Verify functionality of hardware and software components

            - Troubleshoot hardware and software issues in person, remotely and via phone

            - Assist employees with computer problems and answer their questions

            - Conduct daily network backup operations

            I hope you get a sense of my dedication and effectiveness for the job with these few examples. I’d be quite
            eager to bring this same pride-of-work over to Cellubop Gershwin as the next IT technician.

            If you would provide me the chance, I’d love to discuss further how I can best meet your company’s upcoming
            goals and information technology initiatives.

            Sincerely,

            Michael C. Reagan

        </p>
        <p class="m-15">Tips for Writing a Cover Letter

            Tailor each letter to the job. It takes a little extra time, but be sure to write a unique cover letter for
            each job. Your cover letter should be specific to the position you are applying for,relating your skills and
            experiencesto those noted in the job posting.

            Use keywords. One useful way to tailor your letter to the job is to usekeywordsfrom the job posting. Circle
            any words from the job posting that seem critical to the job, such as specific skills or qualifications. Try
            to use some of these words in your letter. This way, at a glance, the employer can see that you match the
            requirements of the job.

            Explain how you will add value. Think of concrete ways to prove you will add value to the company. Include
            examples of specific accomplishments from previous jobs. For example, if you helped reduce turnover by 10%
            at your last company, or implemented a filing strategy that reduced file errors by 15%, include this
            information. Try to quantify your successes when possible to clearly demonstrate how you could add value at
            the company.

            Look at cover letter samples. Check out a few sample cover letters before writing your own. Samples will
            give you an idea of what information to include in your cover letter, and how to format the letter. However,
            never simply copy and paste a sample cover letter. Change the letter to fit your specific skills and
            experiences, and the job you are applying for.

            Edit, edit, edit. Your cover letter is your first, and best, chance to sell the hiring manager on your
            candidacy for employment,so make sure it's perfect.

            Read through your letter, proofreading it for any spelling or grammar errors. Ask a friend, family member,
            or career counselor to read it as well. You want to make sure the letter is polished before submiting it.

            THREE WORDS AND/ OR A NUMBER
        </p>
        <p class="m-15">When writing cover letters you need to use a standard format. Remember that the address of the
            person you are writing to always appears on the left-hand side of the page and your own address is in the
            top right-hand corner.

            Always make sure you start and end your cover letters correctly. If you are writing to Mrs. Linda Carr then
            you should start the letter ‘Dear Mrs Carr’ and finish it with ‘Yours sincerely’. Note that ‘sincerely’ has
            a small ‘s’, not a capital letter.

            If the advertisement asks you to send your application to Melanie Thompson, how would you begin your letter?
            ‘Dear Melanie’? ‘Dear Melanie Thompson’? ‘Dear Mrs Thompson’ is not really appropriate as she might not be
            married. It is probably safe to put ‘Dear Melanie Thompson’.

            If the advertisement just says ‘reply to J. Brown’, how would you address the letter? ‘Dear Sir?’ or ‘Dear
            Madam’? or ‘Dear Mr Brown’? You should ring the company and find out J. Brown’s full name and whether this
            person is a man or a woman.

            Remember that letter etiquette costs you nothing, but it can really pay dividends and you may be the only
            person who has made the effort to find out. This could help to make you different from all the other
            applicants and being noticed is important if you are going to get invited for interview.

            If the advertisement just states: ‘Write to the Human Resources Department’ or ‘Reply to Atlas Travel’, it
            may not be possible for you to find out who will be dealing with your reply. In these cases, you will have
            to start your letter ‘Dear Sir/Madam’ and finish the letter with ‘Yours faithfully’ with a small ‘f’.

        <span>1. What should your cover letter be based on?
            <span style="color: red;"> a standard format </span><br>
            2.Where does the address of the recipient appear on the page?
            <span style="color: red;"> on the left </span> from the job advertisement.<br>
            3.What expression do you use to end the letter if you know who it is addressed to?
            <span style="color: red;">Yours sincerely</span> achievements from your last job.<br>
            4.What should you do if you want to know the recipient’s full name?
            <span style="color: red;"> ring the company</span> the job you are applying for.<br>
            5. What might be beneficial when you attend a job interview?

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">TECHNICAL INTERVIEW</h3>
        <p class="m-15">1.WHAT IS A TECHNICAL INTERVIEW?

            Technical interviews are common amongst employers recruiting for engineering, science or IT roles.
            Essentially, it’s an interview to assess your technical knowledge required for the role and the organization
            you wish to work for.

            Some questions might focus less on technical knowledge, more on how you think. Such questions are looking to
            test your problem solving or your numerical reasoning abilities. This might involve being asked a few
            brainteasers or undertaking a numerical reasoning test.

            Not all technical interviews will be conducted face-to-face; some might be telephone interviews while others
            might be conducted over Skype.

            2.WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING FOR IN A TECHNICAL INTERVIEW?

            Obviously, the first thing they’ll be assessing is the extent of your technical knowledge. This will be the
            knowledge base required to thrive in the job, as well as an understanding and interest in different
            technologies and the industry. They might also test how you can practically apply that knowledge to real
            working situations.

            However, assessing technical knowledge might not be the only point of the interview. They could also be
            looking at how you set about solving a problem, i.e. how you think, and, importantly, how you communicate
            your thinking during the interview.

            They’ll be looking at how articulate and personable you are and how well you can explain and analyze things,
            particularly if the role requires you to compile presentations, write reports or offer technological
            assistance,

            They’re not only looking for a correct answer, but how you reach that answer. They might be testing your
            reasoning and analytical skills, as well as whether you can think laterally and creatively.

            3. WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS WILL I BE ASKED IN A TECHNICAL INTERVIEW?

            The likelihood is that most of the technical questions in the interview will relate directly to the job
            role. Therefore, you can get a good idea of what questions they might ask you from the job advert.

            Most job descriptions will specify a set of essential technical skills and, rather than take your word for
            it, they’ll want to see those skills and knowledge in action.

            The kind of questions will vary from role to role. Your first point of reference, particularly for a big
            graduate employer, should be their website, as they might post examples of the sort of questions they’ll
            ask.

            You can also find plenty of websites with lists of technical questions, which you can use to test yourself.
            However, you should always check the sources of the website; some simply post hearsay.

            All in all, during a standard technical interview they might expect you to complete a task, such as coding,
            or they might ask questions that test how you would use your technical knowledge in a real-life situation.

            notice the way of candidate explain and analyze things, especially the job requires them to compile

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">THE BIGGEST JOB INTERVIEW MISTAKES</h3>
        <p class="m-15">What shouldn't you do when interviewing? There are mistakes you can make that will knock you out
            of the contention, or make an interviewer think twice about inviting you for a second interview or offering
            you a job. Spend time preparing to interview, so these don't happen to you!

            Not Preparing: Not being able to answer the question "What do you know about this company?" might just end
            your quest for employment, at least with this employer. Background information including company history,
            locations, divisions, and a mission statement are available in an "About Us" section on most company
            websites. Review it ahead of time, then print it out and read it over just before your interview to refresh
            your memory. Also check the company's LinkedIn page and Facebook page, if they have one. You should be
            prepared to answer the most common interview questions and know which of your qualifications and experience
            are most relevant to the position.

            Dress Inappropriately: Dressing inappropriately can work both ways — outfits can too casual or too formal
            for a position. Calibrate your interview outfit to the industry and company style. You will certainly want
            to wear a suit if you are interviewing for a professional position. When interviewing for a summer job at
            your local theme park or as a lifeguard, though, a suit just doesn't make sense. Instead, dress in neat and
            casual attire. If you aren't sure what to wear, visit the organization and watch employees coming in and out
            of the office to see what they are wearing.

            Poor Communication Skills: It's important to communicate well with everyone you meet in your search for
            employment. It is, however, most important to positively connect with the person who might hire you. Shake
            hands, make eye contact, exude confidence, engage the person you are speaking with, and you will let the
            interviewer know that you are an excellent candidate for this position — before you even answer an interview
            question.

            Fuzzy Facts: Even if you submitted a resume when you applied for the job, you may also be asked to fill out
            a job application. Make sure you know the information you will need to complete an application including
            dates of prior employment, graduation dates, and employer contact information.

            Give the Wrong Answer: Make sure you listen to questions and take a moment to gather the thoughts before you
            respond. Like the following candidate, you'll knock yourself out of contention if you give the wrong answer.

            The interviewer had completely described a sales and marketing position to the candidate. She emphasized
            that cold calling and prospecting were the most important skills and experiences needed for the position.
            The candidate responded to the question about what she did or didn't like to do in sales, with these words:
            "I hate to do cold calling and prospecting, and I'm not good at it." That response ensured that she wouldn't
            get the job!
        </p>
        <span>There are five common mistakes that candidates can make during the interview. They should consider to
            avoid these mistakes in order to have a great interview. Firstly, they should make a list of questions about
            (1)<span style="color: red;">background information</span>
            including the history, locations, divisions and a mission statement of the company which are easy to find in
            "About Us" section on website companies. They should also prepare some questions related to their
            qualifications and experience which are most (2)<span style="color: red;">relevant</span>
            to the position. Secondly, they should dress appropriately, especially for professional positions.
            Candidates can visit the organization and notice the ways of the employees wearing to find suitable clothes
            for the interview. Next, it is important for candidates to (3)<span style="color: red;">positively
                connect</span>
            with the recruiters by shaking hands, keeping eye contact and showing their confidence. In addition, they
            should make sure about the information that they will be asked to fill out (4)span style="color: red;">a job
            application</span>
        . Finally, they should<span style="color: red;">listen to questions</span>
        and spend little time gathering the thoughts before responding.

        <p class="m-15">TIPS FOR VIDEO JOB INTERVIEW

            Video job interviews are an increasingly common part of the hiring process. These interviews can take
            several forms. If you have one coming up, it’s a good idea to familiarize yourself with all the variables so
            you can be prepared. In this guide, we’ll walk you through the types of video interviews, what you should
            wear, and helpful tips on body language and eye contact.

            1. Live video interviews

            Some interviews will be live, meaning that you might join a video conference from a link that the employer
            shares with you, or you might receive a call via Skype, Google Hangouts or another video conference
            provider. Once connected, you’ll be able to see and speak with an interviewer on the other end.

            If you’re using a personal Skype or Google account, make sure that you have a professional username and
            check your privacy settings. If you have any concern about whether your username is professional enough, you
            may want to set up a new account for your video interviews just in case.

            2. What to wear for a video interview

            For your video interview, you should dress professionally—the same way you would for an in-person interview.

            To look your best on camera, avoid bright colors and patterns and opt for softer colors instead. If you are
            wearing a tie, wear a solid color rather than a patterned one. If you wear glasses, adjust the lighting in
            the room to reduce glare from the lenses.

            Position the camera so that you are looking up slightly and centered on the screen. While it’s likely that
            the interviewer will only see your upper half, it’s still a good idea to wear professional pants or a skirt
            in case you need to stand up for any reason.

            3. Video interview body language

            Eye contact is regarded as the most crucial body language during an in-person interview, and you want to
            convey that same level of connection during a video interview.

            Throughout the interview, keep your mood upbeat and convey optimism with your body language. One way to
            achieve this is to have good posture. Sit in your chair with your back straight and your shoulders open.
            Feet can be planted on the floor and arms can rest in your lap or on the desk.

            When you’re listening, nod and smile when appropriate to communicate that you’re giving them your full
            attention. Use hand gestures when it feels appropriate and keep your movements close to your body. Avoid
            fidgeting or letting your gaze drift away from the device.

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">IMPORTANT TIME MANAGEMENT SKILLS FOR WORKPLACE SUCCESS</h3>
        <p class="m-15">A. What Are Time Management Skills?

            Time management means working efficiently, and employers in every industry look for staff that can make
            optimal use of the time available to them on the job. Saving time saves the organization money and increases
            revenue.

            Effective time management requires staff to analyze their workload, assign priorities, and maintain focus on
            productive endeavors.

            Employees who are excellent time managers can eliminate distractions and enlist support from colleagues to
            help accomplish their goals.

            B. Types of Time Management Skills

            1. Prioritizing

            It might be impossible to do every single minute task expected of you. You also might want to do everything
            all at once. But you must prioritize so that you are able to complete the most important tasks in an order
            that makes sense. When assigning priority, consider such factors as when each task needs to be done, how
            long it might take, how important it might be to others in the organization, what could happen if a task is
            not done, and whether any task might be interrupted by bottlenecks in the process.

            2. Scheduling

            Scheduling is important, because some tasks have to be done at specific times. Scheduling affects your day,
            your week, your month, as well as other people’s work flow. Most have specific times of the day when they
            are more or less productive as a result of energy levels and demands of the day. Schedules can be a good way
            to avoid procrastination, too.

            3. Task Management

            To-do list (properly prioritized and integrated with your schedule) is a great way to avoid forgetting
            something important. They are also a great way to avoid spending all day thinking about everything you have
            to do. Remembering tasks takes energy and thinking about everything you have to do all week can be
            exhausting and overwhelming. Split all the necessary tasks up into a list for each day, and you won’t have
            to worry all of it all at once. Just take your tasks one day at a time.

            4. Workload Management

            Pacing your work, even though it may seem an odd thing to call a skill, is an important time management
            concept. Although working long hours or skipping breaks can sometimes improve productivity in the
            short-term, your exhaustion later will ensure that your overall productivity actually drops. Except for rare
            emergencies, it is important to resist the temptation to over-work. Include necessary breaks, and a sensible
            quitting time, in your schedule.

            Knowing and enforcing an optimum workload for yourself ensures consistency in your performance and avoids
            burnout. Employers want to be able to count on you for the long-term.

        <h3 style="text-align: center;">TIPS TO DETERMINE AND COMMUNICATE SALARY EXPECTATIONS</h3>
        <p class="m-15">While a question about your salary expectations is one of the most straightforward things
            employers ask during a job interview, it’s can be stressful to talk about money. You can manage this stress
            by preparing your answers to salary related questions ahead of time. If you do research on average
            compensation for both the role and your experience level, you can have productive and informative
            conversations about pay with your potential employers.

            Sharing salary information with an interviewer can feel uncomfortable, especially if you’re not accustomed
            to being asked this question and are discussing your ideal compensation for the first time. To help the
            conversation go smoothly and make sure you get a fair salary, here are a few additional pointers:

            Aim high
            Once you know the average salary range for a position, consider padding your expectations. In most cases,
            employers are going to start you off at the lower end of the amount you provide. By aiming higher, you can
            make sure that, even if they offer the lowest number, you’ll still be making your target number. For
            example, if you want to make $45,000, don’t say you’re looking for a salary between $40,000 and $50,000.
            Instead, give a range of $45,000 to $50,000.

            Be confident
            Some employers are interested in your answer as well as your delivery. If you’re confident and self-assured,
            it will show you know your worth and, while you might be open to negotiation, you’re not going to accept
            less than you know you deserve. Don’t sell yourself short in an attempt to move forward or you could end up
            making too little.

            Explain your reasoning
            While you don’t need to get too detailed in explaining how you arrived at your salary expectations, it
            doesn’t hurt to share how you arrived at that number. Highlighting your experience or educational level can
            add justification for your salary, especially if you’re aiming above the local average. Be careful not to
            overshoot the amount too much or you could be considered overqualified. Here’s an example of how to apply
            this tip:

            “The average salary for this position in this area for a professional with my level of experience is between
            $110,000 and $115,000, so that would be my salary expectation for this role.”

            When an interviewer asks about your salary expectations, having a well-formulated, data-backed answer will
            ensure you’re not undercutting yourself or aiming over the market value. By giving an honest, informed
            response, you can help the interviewer better understand whether your expectations align and, if things go
            well, what sort of salary will be attractive enough to get you on board.
